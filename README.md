# Networking Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the files related to the networking project assigned by organization. The project involves designing and implementing a networking solution for a local educational institute. The project is divided into three main parts: investigating networking principles, designing efficient networked systems, and implementing, testing, and diagnosing the networked systems.

## Repository Structure

- `project.pkt`: Packet Tracer file containing the network design and implementation.
- `networking.doc`: The assignment brief for detailed information on the project requirements and deliverables
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for this project.


## Assignment Brief

### Part 1: Investigate Networking Principles

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the report.
2. **Benefits and Limitations of Networks**: Analysis of different types of networks and networking standards.
3. **Impact of Network Topology**: Discussion on speed of communication and bandwidth requirements.
4. **Effectiveness of Networking Systems**: Evaluation of networking systems.
5. **Networking Devices and Server Types**: Examination of different networking devices and servers.
6. **Selection of Server Types**: Justification of server selection based on cost and performance.
7. **Topology Protocol Identification**: Determination of the best topology protocol for efficient networking.

### Part 2: Design Efficient Networked Systems

1. **Design Plan**: Step-by-step plan for designing a Local Area Network (LAN) with a blueprint.
2. **Device Selection Justification**: Explanation of chosen devices for the network design.
3. **Test Plan**: Plan to evaluate the design considering bandwidth and cost constraints.
4. **Security Requirements and Quality of Services**: Justification for selecting specific accessories.
5. **Maintenance Schedule**: Suggested schedule for maintaining the networked system.

### Part 3: Implement, Test, and Diagnose Networked Systems

1. **Network Implementation**: Implementation of the networked system based on the design.
2. **Verification Tests**: Conducting tests such as Ping, extended ping, trace route, telnet, SSH, with screenshots.
3. **Test Results Analysis**: Recording and analyzing test results against expected outcomes.
4. **System Growth Support**: Investigation of functionalities to support device growth and addition of communication devices.
5. **Upgrades and Security Requirements**: Discussion on necessary upgrades and security measures.

## Usage

1. Open the `project.pkt` file using Cisco Packet Tracer to view and interact with the network design.
2. Refer to the assignment brief for detailed information on the project requirements and deliverables.
